AI-Assisted Customer Segmentation & Business Insights

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing customer data to understand spending behavior and income-based segments.
The goal is to help businesses identify high-value customers and make data-driven decisions.

Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI
- Excel
- ChatGPT (for AI-assisted insights)

Project Workflow:
1. Customer data was cleaned and processed using Python.
2. Customers were segmented based on income and spending behavior.
3. Summary tables were created to analyze customer distribution.
4. Interactive Power BI dashboards were built for visualization.
5. AI tools were used to generate and validate business insights.

Key Insights:
- High income and high spending customers are the most valuable segment.
- Medium income customers show strong potential for growth.
- Low income and low spending customers require cost-effective targeting strategies.

Outcome:
This project demonstrates how AI-assisted analytics can support business decision-making and customer strategy planning.

Note:
This dashboard represents a learning-focused analytical project.
The objective was to demonstrate customer segmentation logic, dashboard design,
and AI-assisted insight generation rather than production-level metrics.

Future Improvements:
- Refine aggregations and measures for more realistic business metrics.
- Enhance dashboard interactivity with slicers and advanced KPIs.
